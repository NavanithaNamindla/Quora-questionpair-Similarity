## Problem Statement
  Identify which questions on Quora are duplicate. This could be useful to instantly provide answers to questions that have already been answered. 
  We are tasked with predicting whether a pair of questions are duplicates or not.
In Order to predict the questions are similar or not we used Following Machine Learning Models 
  1. XGBoost Classifier
  2. Random Forest Classifier
  3. Logistic Regression Classifier
  4. Decision tree Classifier
## Results
                               
**Models**                         **Accuracy Score**
Decision Tree-------------------->80.35% ,
Random Forest-------------------->80.35% ,
Logistic Regression-------------->71.00% ,
XGBoost-------------------------->79.7% .

From the Results from above machinelearning methods we can conclude that the Decision Tree and RandomForest Classifier gives the best results according to Accuracy comparing with the other methods.
